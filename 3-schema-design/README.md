## Schema design

### Instructions

For this problem, you'll be designing a database schema for a nationwide chain of coat stores to keep track of their stock of coats. You can use [SQL designer](http://socrates.devbootcamp.com/sql).

There are a lot of coat stores and every coat store has several models of coats. You should design a schema that represents the stores and the coats in each store.

You should include *at least* the following data for the stores:

- name
- location
- years since first opened

You should include *at least* the following data for the coats:

- brand
- color
- length
- price

Note that the words/phrases are not necessarily the names of your columns, but you should try to represent at least all of the attributes above in the columns of your tables.

Be sure to think through how many tables you need, what the attributes should be, and how they relate. Keep it simple.

### To submit
 - Take a screenshot of your schema and add it to your repository.
